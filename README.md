The modification is summarized as below:
1. common.c, common.h
Remove aes which is used for hybridencryption in cbc mode (this depends on openssl)
The session key is part of randomized point generated by PBC and will be forwarded to top function
(originally used in aes cbc, and original IV is fixed)

Also, the aes_buf part in *.cpabe is removed


2. enc.c, dec.c
Write the session key and IV to seperate file (keyfile_enc, and keyfile_dec)
The file can then be readout for hybrid encryption using other ciphers

3. testread.c
Sample program to read the file and save to eStream data structure

4. httpd.c
Use in uvcstreamer

This software provides several tools implementing a scheme for
"ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption" (CP-ABE).

To install this software, you will need to have the Pairing-Based
Cryptography (PBC) library installed. You can get it from the
following page:

   http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/

For more information on CP-ABE and a tutorial on using the tools, see
